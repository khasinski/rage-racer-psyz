# PSY-Z

PSY-Z SDK is a drop-in replacement for the PlayStation 1 Runtime Library called PSY-Q, allowing games designed for the PlayStation 1 to be compiled and run natively on any other platform.

PSY-Z is not an emulator or a static recompiler. It is a porting library written in C that replaces as many API calls as possible with counterparts on other platforms. Currently, it targets multiple platforms, supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures out of the box. The same applications and games will work on all platforms, including the PlayStation 1, with minimal changes.

PSY-Z adheres to the PSY-Q library contracts, focusing on compatibility rather than accuracy. It does not aim to produce 1:1 output compared to real hardware and does not reproduce game bugs that rely on misuse of the PlayStation 1 hardware. The goal is to help port games and run them as native applications.

PSY-Z offers a highly accurate GPU and SPU emulation, accessible through a list of public endpoints. It is theoretically possible to use PSY-Z as a backend for new emulators and static recompilers.

## Supported platforms

The platforms currently supported include:

- **Linux** (i686, x86_64)
- **macOS** (ARM64)
- **Windows** (x86, x64, ARM64) with support for MSVC, Clang, and MinGW
- **PlayStation Portable** via its [dedicated backend](psyz/src/psp/README.md)

PSY-Z is designed to be extensible, and support for additional platforms may be added in the future.

## PSY-Q decomp

To achieve a high level of API compatibility and accuracy, PSY-Z utilizes decompiled PSY-Q code that matches the original binaries exactly. This decompilation is an ongoing process. Please navigate to the `decomp/` directory for more details.

This decomp is a spin-off of [sotn-decomp psxsdk](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/tree/master/src/main/psxsdk) and reuses from the [PSY-Q decomp by Sozud](https://github.com/sozud/psy-q-decomp).

## Integrate PSY-Z SDK

Porting a PlayStation 1 game or application to PSY-Z requires careful code modifications and build system integration to ensure compatibility across both the original PlayStation 1 hardware and modern platforms.

For a comprehensive guide, please refer to the **[Porting Guide](PORTING_GUIDE.md)**.

You can also look into the `samples/` directory for complete examples on how to set up a project to target both PlayStation 1 hardware and PSY-Z on PC.

## Set-up the PSY-Z SDK

At the root of the directory run `make -j`. This will download PSY-Q SDK 4.7 and populate `nugget/psyq` with the transformed `include` and `lib` folders. PCSX Redux will also be downloaded to compile the tool `psyq-obj-parser`, necessary to generate the libraries. This might take a while.

`nugget` is an important step to ensure you can cross-compile your source code to use both PSY-Z and PSY-Q. If you are not interested on cross-compiling your homebrew to both PlayStation 1 and PC, you can skip this step.

## Samples

Most of these examples are adaptations of the original PSY-Q SDK samples, designed to target both PS1 and all PSY-Z platforms. This is achieved via [nugget](https://github.com//pcsx-redux/nugget).

These samples are frequently used to test the quality of PSY-Z, assesting the feature set and to catch regressions.

## Architecture

The SDK is structured into three major folders:

### src/psyz

Contains the core of the SDK. The majority of the SDK calls are reimplemented here. Whenever an API call is platform-specific, the call is redirected to an equivalent function with the `My` prefix (e.g., `LoadImage` internally calls `MyLoadImage`). All platform-specific code is located in `src/platform`.

### src/platform

Platform-specific logic is found here. Each platform uses a subset of the source files in this folder. The build script instructs the linker to decide what platform-specific code needs to be used in the final executable. This means no `#ifdef` spam or function pointers. Everything is statically linked whenever possible.

### decomp/src

All the code in this folder mirrors the original PSY-Q libraries and it is powered by the matching decompilation of PSY-Q. Currently it targets PSY-Q 4.0.

## Why develop PSY-Z?

Before starting this project, I tried using both [libValkyrie](https://github.com/Gh0stBlade/libValkyrie) and [PsyCross](https://github.com/OpenDriver2/PsyCross/). However, each presented its own challenges, such as lack of 64-bit support, insufficient documentation, missing samples, or inflexibility when porting to new platforms. PSY-Z aims to solve these issues and more.

I also became increasingly fascinated by the PlayStation 1 hardware due to its simplicity and versatility. This project is a personal opportunity to learn more.
